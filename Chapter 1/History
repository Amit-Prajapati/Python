Should I use python 2 or 3 for my development activity???
Reference: https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3
>> Python 2 is used as default on most of the linux distributor.
For scripting users prefere 2 so they don't require any additional package or library to install on the servers.
>> one of the difference is that, print statement replaced by print function. eg. print x, became print (x, end=" ")
